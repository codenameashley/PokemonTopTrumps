# PokemonTopTrumps
My first python project for CFG
- the 1st upload is what I presented to CFG python class. It's short, only plays 1 card and 1 round. It also has a mistake where value for height and weight is switched. (My error when listing stats)
- the 2nd upload is the extended version of the project. It's very long, it plays 3 rounds, and there are 5 cards to choose from.
    - Additonal things are - input of your name & team, random generated opponent, scores are logged in a list and resets every time code is re-run 
    - Dialogue imitates pokemon in gameboy  
    - 2nd upload works most of the time, however it does run into some error when choosing certain combinations of card and stat.
    - I am still trying to figure out how to fix this.
