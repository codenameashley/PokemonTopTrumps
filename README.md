My first python project for CFG
- the 1st upload is what I presented to CFG python class. It's short and only plays 1 card and 1 round. It also has a mistake
- the 2nd upload is the extended version of the project. It's very long, it plays 3 rounds, and there are 5 cards to choose from.   
    - 2nd uploads works most of the time, however it does run into some error when choosing certain combinations of card and stat.
    - I am still trying to figure out how to fix this.
